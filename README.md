Prerequisites:
Latest Node.js with NPM.
The Bot Framework Emulator.
Bots built using Bot Builder are designed to be stateless so that they can easily be scaled to run across multiple compute nodes. Because of that you should generally avoid the temptation to save state using a global variable or function closure. Doing so will create issues when you want to scale out your bot. Instead leverage the data bags above to persist temporary and permanent state.
